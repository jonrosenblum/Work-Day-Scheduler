# Work-Day-Scheduler

## Description

AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively

### Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner

- THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
  WHEN I scroll down
- THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours
  WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
- THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
  WHEN I click into a time block
- THEN I can enter an event
  WHEN I click the save button for that time block
- THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
  WHEN I refresh the page
- THEN the saved events persist

### Usage

This project can be used as a reference for a script that leverages a date and time object for dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. It most notably saves text locally upon a button's click. Additionally, if you choose to build the script, it offers a solution with which you can compare yours.
